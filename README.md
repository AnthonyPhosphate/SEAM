SEAM: a Spatial single nuclEar metAboloMics method for dissecting tissue microenvironment
===========================================================================

![Alt text](SEAM/data/img/SEAM_whole.png?raw=true "SEAM overview")

``SEAM`` is a scalable platform combining high resolution imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) and a series of computational algorithms, that can display multiscale/multicolor tissue tomography together with identification and clustering of single nuclei by their in situ metabolic fingerprints.
